# Project Readme

## Overview

During this project, I gained valuable experience working in different Linux-based environments. The project involved creating, modifying, and testing directories and files within repositories named ex00-ex04. Throughout the process, I utilized various Linux commands, such as `cd`, `ls -l`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and others, for specific tasks.

## Commands Used

- `cd`: Change directory
- `ls -l`: List files with detailed information
- `cat`: Display file contents
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory
- `touch`: Create an empty file
- `tar`: Archive files

## File Size Checking

I learned how to check the size of a file using the `ls -l` command, gaining insights into the storage requirements of different files in the project.

## Archiving Files

Understanding the concept of `.tar` files, I successfully created an archive using the appropriate `tar` command. This helped organize and store multiple files efficiently.

## GitHub Integration

The project introduced me to GitHub, a powerful platform for version control. I utilized various Git commands to manage and share my work. Pushing the directories and files to GitHub allows others to easily access and review my work, contributing to the visibility of my digital profile.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to WOJ EDUCATION for providing this valuable opportunity. The project not only enhanced my technical skills but also introduced me to essential tools and practices in the software development and version control landscape.

Thank you for the enriching experience!
